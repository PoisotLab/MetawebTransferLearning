There is no geographical overlap with either the Okhotsk Sea or the East Greenland–Svalbard–Barents Sea subpopulations, which are assessed separately. Bockstoce and Burns (1993) suggested some movement of Bowheads between the BCB area and the eastern Canadian Arctic based on two whaling irons found in whales taken in the Chukchi Sea that apparently came from ships that only hunted in the northwestern Atlantic. However, according to Givens <em>et al</em>. (2010) “the degree of genetic mixing has been extremely small” between these two regions. Based on mtDNA and single nucleotide polymorphisms, Baird <em>et al</em>. (2018) found clear genetic differentiation between BCB and Okhotsk Sea Bowheads, and less clear, but statistically significant, differentiation between BCB Bowheads and those Bowheads sampled in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Interchange between the BCB subpopulation and Bowhead Whales in the eastern Canadian Arctic and West Greenland waters may become more common as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012)."

41280,Lepus europaeus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,LAGOMORPHA,MAMMALIA,LEPORIDAE,Lepus,europaeus,,,,,"Pallas, 1778","The taxonomy of <em>Lepus europaeus </em>is still under debate. Clear distinction to other taxa is difficult due to sympatric occurrences with other <em>Lepus</em> species. The European Hare was formerly included in the Cape Hare (<em>L. capensis</em>) based on a cline in morphological characters (mainly size) from north-eastern Africa eastwards across the northern Arabian peninsula, the Middle East and northwards through Israel to Turkey (Petter 1961). A reanalysis showed a discontinuity between smaller “<em>capensis</em>” and larger “<em>europaeus</em>” running from the eastern Mediterranean coast through Iran (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008). A study of the nuclear gene pool of the Cape Hare, the European Hare and the North African Hare, indicated that the North African Hare as well as the European Hare belong to the Cape Hare (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2005). However, a study of the mt DNA of these three groups indicated a significant degree of divergence supporting species specific designation (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008a, 2008b). These studies show that genetic differentiation between the Cape Hare and the European Hare might be attributed to geographic distance rather than divergence. Until conclusive evidence of a single species complex is available in order to support a change in the taxonomic status of the European Hare, it remains a true species (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018, Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016).<br/> <br/> There are 16 subspecies: <em>Lepus europaeus caspicus, L. e. connori, L. e. creticus, L. e. cyprius, L. e. cyrensis, L. e. europaeus, L. e. hybridus, L. e. judeae, L. e. karpathorum, L. e. medius, L. e. occidentalis, L. e. parnassius, L. e. ponticus, L. e. rhodius, L. e. syriacus</em>, and <em>L. e. transsylvanicus</em> (Hoffmann and Smith 2005). It is felt that there is considerable variability in many of these forms and that distinctions between subspecies may be arbitrary as they are mostly based on size and colour. Molecular phylogenetic studies in Spain revealed that the Cantabric population has singular mt DNA compared to other European populations (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004). A review of the taxonomy of this species is necessary (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018, Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016)."

There is still some debate surrounding whether Moose comprise one or two species. Groves and Grubb (1987) called them ""semi-species"". Boeskorov (1997) proposed that the chromosomal races of <em>Alces alces </em>were different species, however, Bowyer <em>et al.</em> (2000) cautioned that chromosome numbers might be a poor designator of species among large mammals. Based on cited sources that documented differences between Eurasian Elk and Moose, Geist (1998) recommended separation at the subspecies level (i.e., <em>Alces alces alces</em> Linneaus, 1758 and <em>Alces alces americanus</em> Clinton, 1822). Geist (1998) noted a broad zone of hybridization between the two forms in central and eastern Siberia but Boeskorov (2003) identifies the Yenisei River as the boundary between the ranges of the two putative species. There are no differences in antler morphology on either side of the river, however, suggesting substantial gene flow (Kolesnikov and Kozlovskii 2014). Moreover, genetic analyses have generally supported distinguishing the two at the subspecific level (Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> 2002 a,b; Udina <em>et al.</em> 2002; Hundertmark and Bowyer 2004); further research is needed before a consensus would support species-level classification.<br/><br/>Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> (2002b) report that analysis of mtDNA revealed three haplogroups, one entirely Asian, one primarily European and one primarily North American.

Here we use either name or <em>Rangifer</em>. <br/><br/>Identification of subspecies has changed over time (Banfield 1961, Geist 2007) and currently, Grubb (2005) lists 14 sub-species of which two are extinct: <em>eogroenlandicus </em>and <em>dawsoni</em>, however, the latter may have been an island dwarf form (Byun <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Russia, the use of subspecies differs from Grubb (2005) as <em>angustirostris </em>is recognized but not <em>buskensis </em>(I. Mizin pers. comm.). The subspecies are distinguished largely on skeletal and skull measurements, antler architecture and behaviour. The major groupings of subspecies are Boreal forest, continental tundra and high Arctic island. Based on current abundance, continental tundra caribou are the most numerous (56%) relative to mountain (19%), the forest (14%) and Arctic island (11%). <br/><br/>The current diversity of <em>Rangifer </em>resulted from local adaptations, which followed large-scale changes in distribution as continental glaciations advanced and retreated during the Pleistocene (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). Analyses of mitochondrial and nucleotide DNA reveal that glaciations divided <em>Rangifer </em>into two lineages. The ice sheets were more extensive in North Ameri<em>ca.</em> Thus, the Euro-Beringia lineage was restricted to Alaska while the North American lineage was restricted to south of the ice sheets. The Euro-Beringia lineage is genetically the most varied and is widely distributed from Eurasia to northwestern America also including Greenland, Svalbard and the Canadian Arctic island archipelagos (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). The second lineage, the North American lineage (essentially woodland caribou), has less genetic variation and a more restricted distribution limited to Newfoundland/Labrador and eastern Canada. After deglaciation about 10,000 years ago, changing distribution during recolonization, secondary contact between the two lineages occurred in central and western Canada (Weckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Genetic variability is typically high among the larger migratory herds of migratory tundra Caribou (Zittlau 2004) because the effective population size is large and geographic barriers are largely lacking. Elsewhere in the mountains, genetic variation reveals a complex history influenced by events including ancient volcanic eruptions, founder events, geography and changing abundance and distribution of neighbouring herds (Kuhn <em>et al.</em> 2010, Serrouya <em>et al.</em> 2012). On the arctic islands, genetic variation is reduced because those populations have been through severe reductions in abundance with consequent genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift (Zittlau 2004, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Dispersal whether innate or environmental is largely unrecorded in <em>Rangifer </em>except at the scale of genetic migration. DNA analyses have revealed low rates of male-biased genetic flow between neighbouring and geographically dispersed <em>Rangifer </em>(Boulet <em>et al.</em> 2005, Roffler <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>The subspecies designations are based on an outdated taxonomy and are inconsistent with current understanding of evolutionary relationships and ecology (Flagstad and Røed 2003, Zittlau 2005, Røed 2005). However, in the context of conservation and management, recognizable and credible ‘conservation units’ or ‘evolutionary significant units’ are essential. In Canada, for example, COSEWIC (2012) assessed all available information to create 12 designatable units to recognize variability in form, ecology and genetics previously combined in four sub-species. We will refer to recognizable conservation units throughout this assessment as these are the basis for estimating abundance. Then we have summed the subspecies or conservation units to assess <em>Rangifer</em> at the species level."

Clear distinction to other taxa is difficult due to sympatric occurrences with other <em>Lepus</em> species. The European Hare was formerly included in the Cape Hare (<em>L. capensis</em>) based on a cline in morphological characters (mainly size) from north-eastern Africa eastwards across the northern Arabian peninsula, the Middle East and northwards through Israel to Turkey (Petter 1961). A reanalysis showed a discontinuity between smaller “<em>capensis</em>” and larger “<em>europaeus</em>” running from the eastern Mediterranean coast through Iran (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008). A study of the nuclear gene pool of the Cape Hare, the European Hare and the North African Hare, indicated that the North African Hare as well as the European Hare belong to the Cape Hare (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2005). However, a study of the mt DNA of these three groups indicated a significant degree of divergence supporting species specific designation (Ben Slimen <em>et al.</em> 2008a, 2008b). These studies show that genetic differentiation between the Cape Hare and the European Hare might be attributed to geographic distance rather than divergence. Until conclusive evidence of a single species complex is available in order to support a change in the taxonomic status of the European Hare, it remains a true species (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018, Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016).<br/> <br/> There are 16 subspecies: <em>Lepus europaeus caspicus, L. e. connori, L. e. creticus, L. e. cyprius, L. e. cyrensis, L. e. europaeus, L. e. hybridus, L. e. judeae, L. e. karpathorum, L. e. medius, L. e. occidentalis, L. e. parnassius, L. e. ponticus, L. e. rhodius, L. e. syriacus</em>, and <em>L. e. transsylvanicus</em> (Hoffmann and Smith 2005). It is felt that there is considerable variability in many of these forms and that distinctions between subspecies may be arbitrary as they are mostly based on size and colour. Molecular phylogenetic studies in Spain revealed that the Cantabric population has singular mt DNA compared to other European populations (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004).

Most of the scientific literature prior to the late 1990s uses the name <em>B. acutorostrata</em> for all Minke Whales including Antarctic Minke Whales. Since 2000, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has recognized Antarctic Minke Whales as the separate species <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, and provisionally assigns all Northern Hemisphere Minke Whales and all Southern Hemisphere ""Dwarf"" Minke Whales to <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (IWC 2001). This practice has been followed by management and treaty bodies, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). <br/> <br/> The Dwarf Minke Whale is the common name used for&#160;<em>B. acutorostrata</em> in the Southern Hemisphere. It was initially described by Best (1985) and Arnold <em>et al</em>. (1987) in terms of its differences from the Antarctic Minke Whale. Subsequent genetic analyses (Wada <em>et al</em>. 1991, Pastene <em>et al</em>. 1994) revealed that the Dwarf Minke Whale is conspecific with the ""ordinary"" Minke Whale of the Northern Hemisphere, which was given the name Common Minke Whale, while the Antarctic Minke Whale is the separate species <em>B. bonaerensis</em> (see separate Red List assessment).<br/> <br/> Following Rice (1998) the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy provisionally recognizes three subspecies: <em>B. a. acutorostrata</em> (Lacépède, 1804) in the North Atlantic, <em>B. a. scammoni</em> (Deméré, 1986) (= <em>B. a . davidsoni</em>) in the North Pacific, and the Dwarf Minke Whale as an unnamed subspecies in the Southern Hemisphere (Committee on Taxonomy 2017). However, the limited sampling of Dwarf Minke Whales to date does not support the grouping together of all Southern Hemisphere Dwarf Minke Whales. For example, Pastene <em>et al</em>.

The morphological differences between <em>D. delphis </em>and <em>D. capensis</em> in the North Pacific (Heyning and Perrin 1994) were supported by molecular evidence from both mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Rosel<em> et al.</em> 1994). However, the genus exhibits a great deal of morphological variation globally and the criteria used to distinguish between the two species in the North Pacific appear not to apply elsewhere (Best 2007). In South Africa, Samaai <em>et al. </em>(2005) found that based on skull morphology the majority of specimens belonged to<em> D. capensis</em>, however two specimens were within the range for<em> D. delphis</em> from the North Pacific, and a third specimen fell between the ranges for<em> D. delphis </em>and <em>D. capensis </em>(Samaai<em> et al.</em> 2005). The same molecular markers that were used to differentiate the two sympatric species in the North Pacific failed to reveal any genetic distinction between the described morphotypes in South Africa (Best 2007).<br/><br/>Subsequently, Cunha <em>et al.</em> (2015), in a global analysis of <em>Delphinus</em> which included nine specimens from the west coast of South Africa (eastern South Atlantic), concluded that all specimens analysed from the Atlantic Ocean belonged to <em>D. delphis, </em>and that<em> D. capensis</em> was not a genetically valid species.<br/><br/>In 2016 the Society for Marine Mammalogy Committee on Taxonomy removed <em>Delphinus capensis</em> from its accepted list of marine mammal species and now recognises all Common Dolphins globally as belonging to a single species, <em>Delphinus delphis</em> (Committee on Taxonomy 2020).

However, another morphometric study concluded that that form should be considered a subspecies (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2002) and it is currently recognised as such,&#160;<em>D. delphis tropicalis.</em><br/><br/>The non-concordance of morphological and genetic data for Common Dolphins has caused much confusion and a rigorous global taxonomic study of the genus is needed.

Based on morphological data this was suggested earlier by several authors, e.g. Lydekker (1898), Flerov (1952) and Geist (1998) and both recent reviews on cervid taxonomy are in line with this opinion (Groves and Grubb 2011, Mattioli 2011). <br/><br/>A recent analysis (Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015) of the <em>Cervus </em>group has provided the first indications of another, third, species (aside from <em>Cervus nippon</em>). Mitochondrial complete cytochrome b and control region sequences were analysed under a Bayesian coalescent framework to derive phylogeny, with particular attention on populations from Central Asia. The resultant phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed that red deer is differentiated into two robust monophyletic clades corresponding to the western and eastern part of the range. At the species level, molecular data suggested a fourth species should be recognised, the Tarim Red Deer from Central Asia, including the populations from the Yarkand-Tarim and Bukhara regions and Indian Kashmir, which were formerly considered as subspecies of <em>C. elaphus </em>(<em>C. e. yarkandensis</em>, <em>C.e. bactrianus</em> and <em>C.e. hanglu</em>, respectively). The authors suggest this taxon should be recognised as the Tarim Red Deer (<em>Cervus hanglu</em>, Wagner 1844), as the name with priority over<em> C. yarkandensis</em> or<em> C. bactrianus</em>. Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of this taxon to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). We provisionally follow this taxonomy here for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016. However, it should be noted that future clarification on genetic relatedness, especially studies with nuclear markers and a more formal morphological description, may lead to further revisions to the taxonomy of the provisional species,<em> C. hanglu</em>, as more information becomes available.<br/><br/><em>C.c. macneilli</em> and wallichii are included here as subspecies of <em>C. canadensis</em>, both are sometimes placed in the “primitive group” of elaphines (with <em>hanglu</em>) based on morphological characters (Geist 1998, Groves 2003, Wilson and Mittermeier 2011), although genetic data place these taxa with the <em>C. canadensis</em> group (Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). <br/><br/>The North American population of the Wapiti has been split into a number of subspecies by various authors, including <em>manitobensis</em>, <em>nelsoni</em>, <em>roosevelti</em>, <em>nannodes</em>, <em>canadensis </em>and <em>merriam </em>(e.g. Meredith <em>et al.</em> 2007, Speller <em>et al.</em> 2014). Polziehn <em>et al.</em> (1998) conducted a phylogenetic study of North American Wapiti and concluded that there is a slight difference between North American Wapiti populations, most likely due to the limited numbers of founders of these populations, but that Roosevelt Elk (<em>Cervus</em> <em>canadensis roosevelti</em>) and Tule Elk (<em>C. c. nannodes</em>) are monophyletic which supports their subspecific status. Polziehn <em>et al.</em> (2000) questioned the subspecific status of <em>C. c. manitobensis</em> and <em>C. c. nelsoni </em>following analysis of 11 populations of North American Elk for genetic diversity. <br/><br/>Here we recognise the subspecies and their distributions as follows: <br/><br/><em>C. c. canadensis</em> – N America<br/><em>C. c. alashanicus</em> – N China<br/><em>C. c. nannodes</em> - California<br/><em>C. c. roosevelti </em>- Vancouver Island, Washington state and Oregon <br/><em>C. c. sibiricus</em> – NE Kazakhstan and N Xinjiang to S Siberia and N Mongolia<br/><em>C. c. xanthopygus</em> – SE Siberia, Russian Far East, Ussuriland, Manchuria<br/><em>C. c. macneilli</em> – Lydekker 1909 (Central and SW China (N Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, W Sichuan and E Xizang)<br/><em>C. c. wallichii</em> - G.

This species has been intensively studied only in Hawaii (Baird 2016) and more recently in New Zealand (Zaeschmar 2014). In Hawaii, three subpopulations have been identified based on a combination of genetic studies (Martien <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014), satellite tagging (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2010, 2012, 2014, Bradford <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014a), and analyses of photo-identification data (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2008, Baird 2016). These include two partially overlapping insular populations, one around the main Hawaiian Islands, and one in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, as well as a partially overlapping pelagic population that ranges throughout and beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Archipelago. In New Zealand, based on high resighting rates of photo-identified individuals and a relatively small number of individuals documented, it is likely that this represents a distinct subpopulation (Zaeschmar 2014). While the number of subpopulations world-wide is unknown, this is due primarily to incomplete sampling in most of the range. Based on the evidence from Hawaii, subpopulation structure likely exists throughout their range.</span></span></span></span>"

Animals in the North Pacific are similar in size and morphology to North Atlantic Blue Whales and are also regarded as<em> B. m. musculus</em>, pending a genetic comparison of these populations. The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em> is distinguished by its large body size and Antarctic distribution in summer. The Pygmy Blue Whale <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has a number of morphological characteristics that distinguish it from <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and <em>B. m. musculus</em>. It occurs in the Indian Ocean, excluding the Antarctic, from Africa and Madagascar across to Indonesia and Australia, and in the southwestern Pacific, including Tasmania and New Zealand. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean have been tentatively assigned the name<em> B. m. indica</em>, but a clear distinction between <em>B. m. indica </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has not yet been established.<br/><br/>Blue Whales in the southeastern Pacific are intermediate in size between <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and<em> B. m. brevicauda</em> (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and are genetically differentiated from both groups (LeDuc<em> et al.</em> 2017).

The Common Bottlenose Dolphin has a worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate latitudes but exhibits a strong ability to adapt to local conditions, a complex social structure and strong site fidelity which results in considerable habitat partitioning throughout its range. This, in turn, has created strong population differentiation accompanied, in some cases, by marked morphological differentiation. The taxonomy of Bottlenose Dolphins is confused due to this geographical variation, and it is very possible that additional species will be recognized in the future.<br/><br/>Three subspecies are currently recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy (2017) and a recent re-assessment of <em>Tursiops </em>taxonomy worldwide conducted by the International Whaling Commission confirmed their validity (IWC 2018). These subspecies are the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>T. t. ponticus</em>&#160;Barabash-Nikiforov, 1940) which differs morphologically and genetically from other forms including those in the nearby Mediterranean Sea (Barabash-Nikiforov 1960, Geptner <em>et al.</em> 1976, Natoli <em>et al. </em>2005, Viaud-Martinez <em>et al</em>. 2008).

The third subspecies is the nominate subspecies that includes the remaining Common Bottlenose Dolphins worldwide (<em>T. t. truncatus&#160;</em>(Montagu, 1821)). In the western North Atlantic, two forms, offshore and coastal, are distinguishable on the basis of morphology and ecological markers (Mead and Potter 1995) and have fixed genetic differences (Le Duc and Curry 1997, Hoelzel <em>et al. </em>1998, Kingston <em>et al. </em>2009, Rosel<em> et al.</em> 2009, Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017a) and according to the recent IWC review the coastal population should be recognized as at least a different subspecies."
