# Phylogenetic inference of ecological interactions through network embedding

**Executive summary**: 

1. network decomposition through a truncated-SVD capture the evolutionary signal of species interactions
2. the decomposition into left/right subspaces is unique, represents latent traits for resp. outgoing and incoming edges, and can be used to predict interactions
3. we can infer latent traits for unobserved species based on phylogenetic proximity with observed species
4. we use this information to transfer information from the trophic interaction of European mammals to Canadian mammals for which we have no *a priori* data
