# Metaweb transfer learning

## Introduction

Why we should care about ecological networks yet information 
is scarce and collecting it is hard so we need reliable ways 
to predict them

Why fancy maths/ML is a good toolset - specifically briefly 
mention tools we are using in light of their flexibility and 
how they 'only' need 'limited' data. Segue this into needing 
only phylogeny (refer to Stock 2021 in here)

Maybe something on the value of using phylogenies? They are 
more readily available (and cover a greater geographic 
extent) AND phylogenies tell us a lot about the species - 
trait conservation

Then some sort of 'mission statement' *i.e.* to test this 
method we wanted to see how well we could predict the Canadian 
mammal foodweb using the European foodweb [ref]
and maybe even a brief 
summary of result/value performance

## Methods

Brief overview of the data *i.e* the European metaweb as well 
as the Upham tree. Using GBIF to get a mammals species list as 
well as for taxonomic harmonisation/resolution

SVD/Elbow method

The ML/transfer learning part

Validation techniques approaches

## Results and discussion

> Figure 1 is a multi-paneled output of results: ROC, matrix??

Hey look lots of similarities between Europe and Canada and 
here are some metrics

> Figure 2 is a multi-paneled output of validation: bodymass 
> ratio, Newfoundland metaweb

Challenges of validation - even empirical webs are imperfect 
(FALSE negatives?? I always mix this up...) Need for a suite 
of validation techniques?

## Concluding notes

Something about how great this method is. Might be worth 
discussing ability to 'absorb' inclusion of new species.
